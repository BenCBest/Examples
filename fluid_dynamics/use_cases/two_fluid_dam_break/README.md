A brief description of the cases is found in the following.

DAM BREAK SCENARIO (3D)

A water-filled cuboid is positioned in one part of the domain.
It is released at time 0.0 and the water spreads across the domain driven by gravity.
The water hits an obstacle and splashes develop.
Here, a strong dependency on the spatial resolution can be observed.
Apart from the splashes, even a relatively coarse mesh resolution is able to achieve a good result.
