# PFEMFluidDynamics Examples

## Applications used

You can run yourself 2D examples using the GiD interface of the PfemFluid application.

Select the "kratos" problem data, then select "Pfem" botton, finally the "Pfem Fluid" logo.

Up to now, only 2D examples are ready, so please pick on the 2D icon that will appear.

After opening the Pfem Fluid interface, you will see at the left column the icons of two already prepared examples, one for fluid dynamics and the other accounting for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).

Once you have selected one of the two case, you just have to save the file, create the mesh and run the calculation.
